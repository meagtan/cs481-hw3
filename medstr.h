/*
 * Finding median string of DNA sequences
 * Functions are provided for processing directly on characters, as well as on sequences of two bits
 *  for each nucleotide. Goal is to compare overhead of creating bit sequences with faster searching.
 * The functions ending with _bit operate on sequences of 64-bit numbers containing 32 two-bit nucleotides,
 *  instead of strings of characters, and are used in the final version of the program.
